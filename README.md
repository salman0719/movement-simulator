# Movement Simulator
[Playground](https://movement-simulator.vercel.app/)

This is an experimental project that attempts to align its appearance with a specific website through its implementation of a simple yet interesting interactive functionality. A droid will be placed inside a cellular structure and the user will be provided control to that bot to move it around that structure.
